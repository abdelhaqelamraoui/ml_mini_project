# Projet de Fin de Module en Maching Learning (PFM)

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict prices using a dataset with attributes like 'prix'. It involves implementing various algorithms, preprocessing the data (including encoding and splitting into training/test sets), and evaluating the model's performance. The project will be conducted using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib for visualization and analysis. Detailed steps and instructions will be provided in the project documentation and code files.
